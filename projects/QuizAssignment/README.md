# Java Quiz Assignment

Create a program that allows the user to complete a 5 question quiz on a topic of your choice. The quiz can use input of any type (int, double, boolean, char, String). After answering a question, provide feedback to the user to let them know if they answered correctly or not. Give the correct answer if the user got it wrong. Keep score for the user and at the end of the quiz give them their score/5 and percentage. Ask the user if they wish to take the quiz again. If they choose to repeat the quiz, start it over. If they choose not the repeat the quiz, have the program stop.
