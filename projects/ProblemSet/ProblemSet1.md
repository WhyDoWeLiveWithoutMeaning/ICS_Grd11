Basic Java Programming Problems


1. Write an application that reads three numbers and prints their average


2. Write an application that converts miles to kilometers. One mile equals 1.60935 kilometers. Read the miles value from the user as a double.


3. Write a program that lets you enter a number of hours, and that converts it to days

and hours. For example, 111 hours = 4 days and 15 hours.


4. Chocolate chip cookie problem


There are 12 cookies per box (sold at $1.14) and 24 boxes per carton. Left over boxes are sold for 57¢. Remaining cookies are given away free. Given the number of cookies produced, determine the number of boxes, cartons, left over boxes and the total money made.


Write a program that will ask the user to enter a number of cookies produced. From that information, print the number of cartons, the number of leftover boxes, the number of leftover cookies, and the total profit.


e.g.


Enter the number of cookies baked: 54635


If 54635 cookies were baked you would end up with:


cartons: 189

leftover boxes: 16

leftover cookies: 11

profit: $5,180.16





5. Write a program that creates and prints random lock combinations. Each combination should consist of 3 numbers from 0 to 59 inclusive.



6. Write an application that reads the (x, y) coordinates for two points. Compute the distance between the two points using the following formula:


dist = square root of (x2 – x1)2 + (y2 – y1)2
