# Basic Java Programming Problems


## Problem Set 1

### 1. Write an application that reads three numbers and prints their average


### 2. Write an application that converts miles to kilometers. One mile equals 1.60935 kilometers. Read the miles value from the user as a double.


### 3. Write a program that lets you enter a number of hours, and that converts it to days and hours. For example, 111 hours = 4 days and 15 hours.


### 4. Chocolate chip cookie problem


There are 12 cookies per box (sold at $1.14) and 24 boxes per carton. Left over boxes are sold for 57¢. Remaining cookies are given away free. Given the number of cookies produced, determine the number of boxes, cartons, left over boxes and the total money made.


Write a program that will ask the user to enter a number of cookies produced. From that information, print the number of cartons, the number of leftover boxes, the number of leftover cookies, and the total profit.


e.g.


Enter the number of cookies baked: 54635


If 54635 cookies were baked you would end up with:


cartons: 189

leftover boxes: 16

leftover cookies: 11

profit: $5,180.16


### 5. Write a program that creates and prints random lock combinations. Each combination should consist of 3 numbers from 0 to 59 inclusive.



### 6. Write an application that reads the (x, y) coordinates for two points. Compute the distance between the two points using the following formula:

dist = square root of (x2 – x1)2 + (y2 – y1)2

## Problem Set 2

### 1. Design and implement an application that plays the Hi-Lo guessing game with numbers. The program should pick a random number between 1 and 10. The program should then ask the user to guess the number and print an appropriate message telling the user they were too high, too low, or correct. Display the correct answer for the user.

### 2. A wholesale egg company bases their process on the number of eggs purchased:


0 up to but not including 4 dozen $0.50 per dozen

4 up to but not including 6 dozen $0.45 per dozen

6 up to but not including 11 dozen $0.40 per dozen

11 or more dozen $0.35 per dozen

Extra eggs are priced at 1/12 the per dozen price


Create an Eggs application that prompts the user for the number of eggs, and then calculates the bill.



### 3. Create a program that will ask the user to input the number of hours they worked in a week, and their hourly rate. Have the program calculate their weekly pay. If the user worked more than 40 hours in a week, they should be paid “time and a half” for any hours beyond the 40 hours. (that’s 1.5 times their regular pay)



### 4. Write a program that will ask a user for an amount of fuel in litres, and a price per litre. Your program should then output the total amount you have to pay. To complicate the calculation, there is a discount based on the amount of fuel you purchase. If you purchase 40 litres or more, there is a discount of 5 cents per litre. If you purchase 70 litres or more you get a discount of 8 cents per litre.



### 5. Create a program to determine the raise and new salary for an employee. The input to the program includes the current annual salary for the employee and a number indicating the performance rating (1=excellent, 2=good, and 3=poor). An employee with a rating of 1 will receive a 6% raise, an employee with a rating of 2 will receive a 4% raise, and one with a rating of 3 will receive a 1.5% raise. Print out the amount of the raise, and the employees new salary.


e.g.


Enter your current salary: 56000

Enter your performance rating: 2


Your raise will be: $2240

Your new salary will be $58240




### 6. Design and implement an application that reads an integer value representing a year input by the user. The purpose of the program is to determine if the year is a leap year (and therefore has 29 days in February) in the Gregorian calendar. A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4, unless it is also divisible by 100 but not 400. For example, the year 2003 is not a leap year, but 2004 is. The year 1900 is not a leap year because it is divisible by 100, but the year 2000 is a leap year because even though it is divisible by 100, it is also divisible by 400. Produce an error message for any input value less than 1582 (the year the Gregorian calendar was adopted).
