# Cannon Ball Stacker

## 1.	Write a program that will allow a user to input a number and will calculate how many cannon balls will be required to build a pyramid with that number of levels.  For example, if the user enters 4, the program should output:

A 4 level pyramid will require 30 cannon balls.

## 2.	Write a program that will allow a user to enter a number of cannon balls.  Have the program output the largest number of complete levels that can be made from that number of cannon balls.  Have the program output how many left over cannon balls there will be.  For example, if the user entered 32 cannon balls, the output would be:

32 cannon balls can be stacked into 4 levels.
This will result in 30 balls in the stack, and 2 balls left over.
