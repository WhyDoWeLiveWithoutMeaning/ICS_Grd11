# Java Input, Output, and Storage Assignment

Write a Java program that will ask a user 5 quiz questions. 
You can choose any topic for your quiz. 
Try to use a variety of different data types (int, double, boolean, String) as answers for your questions. Keep all answers to single numbers or words. 
After the user has answered all quiz questions, display a summary of their answers on screen. 

Make sure to save this program where you will be able to find it another day. 
We will improve it later by adding scoring.
