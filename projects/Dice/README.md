# METHOD OVERLOADING ASSIGNMENT

## Write a class called “Dice.”  In you class, write 3 methods called “roll().”  Each of the 3 methods will roll dice in a slightly different way.

•	Method 1
  -	write a method that will return a random value from 1-6
  
  
•	Method 2 
  -	write a method that will accept a number of rolls as a parameter and will return the sum of that  number of rolls of a 6 sided die. (e.g.  roll(2) would return a sum from 2-12)
  
  
•	Method 3
  -	write a method that will accept a number of rolls as a parameter and the number of sides on the dice as a parameter.  Have the method return the sum of the number of rolls of dice with the desired number of sides. (e.g. roll(2,12) would return a value from 2-24)


### Write a class called “DiceTest.”  Make sure to save it in the same folder as “Dice.”  In this program write a simple game that has a player and the computer roll against each other.  Have the user input the character ‘r’ to roll.  The computer should roll automatically.  Print a message stating the result of the rolls and who was higher.  You can use any of the 3 methods from the Dice class to do the rolling.
